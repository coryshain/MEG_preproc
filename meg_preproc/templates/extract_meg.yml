# EVENT EXTRACTION
#
# Instructions for extracting event-related MEG data for regression.
# Whether fields are required or optional is noted in comments.
# Optional fields can be omitted by deleting them.


# Name of experiment; must match name in protocol.txt file.
# REQUIRED
expt_name: <Name>

# List of paths to subject directories.
# REQUIRED
subjects:
  - <Path1>
  - <Path2>
  - <Etc...>

# Path to output directory.
# OPTIONAL: defaults to ./
outdir: ./

# Type of sensor representation to return. One of all (for
# all input sensors), mag (for magnetometers), grad (for
# gradiometers), or gradnorm (for the norm of each gradiometer
# pair at each location). The suffix '+' can be added to
# any of these in order to include gradnorms in addition.
# E.g. "all+" means all sensors and also gradnorms.
# OPTIONAL: defaults to all
sensor_type: all

# Name of cleaning protocol to search for; i.e., <Name> from the <Name>.yml
# config file used to clean the data.
# OPTIONAL: defaults to default_meg
clean_code: default_meg

# Frequency to which to resample data (e.g. 100 for 100Hz).
# OPTIONAL: defaults to Null, for no resampling
resample_to: Null

# Integer code to signal end of item.
# OPTIONAL: defaults to Null, for epoching
end_code: Null

# Map from integer acquisition event codes to human-readable labels for
# events. For example:
#
# event_map:
#   1: condA
#   2: condB
#   255: Fixation
#
# OPTIONAL: defaults to Null, which uses the event code as the label
event_map: Null

# Minimum relative time for defining epochs (if epoching) or preceding
# window before entire items (if not epoching).
# OPTIONAL: defaults to -0.2, i.e. 200ms before onset
epoch_tmin: -0.2

# Maximum relative time for defining epochs (if epoching) or following
# window after entire items (if not epoching).
# OPTIONAL: defaults to 0.8, i.e. 800ms after onset (if epoching) or 800ms after item end
epoch_tmax: 0.8

# Path to CSV file containing word-level data, for experiments coded
# as multi-word events (e.g. one event code for the onset of an entire
# passage). Must at minimum contain columns "condition" (mapping word
# sequences to labels from *event_map*) and "word_onset_time", containing
# the word's onset time relative to the onset of the item.
# OPTIONAL: defaults to Null, for no word-level stimulus data.
word_level_file: Null
